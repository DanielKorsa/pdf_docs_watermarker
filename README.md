# Watermark your documents before sending it to potential landlord / real estate agent
### Pre Story
In some European countries it is common to send documents to real estate agents/ landlords before getting an appointment to visit a rental flat.
Those documents can contain sensetive information, because often it is required to send a job contract, copy of passport and bank statements.
There are well known scammer schemes which fake rental ads and get documents and data of flat hunters for further misuse.
Therefore this script watermarks documents so that they can not be used for further scamming. Additionally, it is possible to track down a person who leaked the documents.
